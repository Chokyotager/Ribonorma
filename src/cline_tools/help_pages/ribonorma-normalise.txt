DESCRIPTION
  Ribonorma Python v1.1

PARAMETERS
[-h]
Shows this interface.

[-method (string)]
Normalisation method. Can be "TPM", "TPMM", "TPMR" or "TPMR2"

[-in (string)]:
Input raw count file with IDs and gene lengths.

[-out (string)]
Optional output file. If not specified, will output to stdout.

[-remove_all_zeroes (boolean)]
Automatically removes genes that have zero counts throughout all samples - this reduces skew in largely Pareto datasets. Default: True

[-infile_separator (string)]
Separator for the input file (i.e. "," for CSV). Default: \t

[-outfile_separator (string)]
Separator for the output file (i.e. "," for CSV). Default: \t

[-has_labels (boolean)]
First row in input datafile are labels. Default: False

[-id_column (int)]
The index of the column (starts counting from 0) of the gene IDs in the input file. Default: 0

[-length_column (int)]
The index of the column (starts counting from 0) of the gene lengths in the input file. Default: 1

[-count_start (int)]
The index of the column (starts counting from 0) where the read counts start. Default: 2

[-phenotype_file (string)]
File for phenotype data - only required for TPMR and TPMR2 calculations.

[-phenotype_file_separator (string)]
Separator for the phenotype file (i.e. "\n") to delimit the different phenotypes/conditions of the RNA sequencing runs.

[-percent_housekeep (float)]
Percentage of genes to consider for the geometric mean calculation. Only required in TPMR/TPMR2. Equivalent to alpha. Default: 10
