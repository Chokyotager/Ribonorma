DESCRIPTION
  Ribonorma Python v1.1

PARAMETERS
[-h]
Shows this interface.

[-in (string)]:
Input normalised file, as generated by ribonorma-normalise.

[-out (string)]
Optional output file. If not specified, will output to stdout.

[-phenotype_file (string)]
File for phenotype data.

[-infile_separator (string)]
Separator for the input file (i.e. "," for CSV). Default: \t

[-outfile_separator (string)]
Separator for the output file (i.e. "," for CSV). Default: \t

[-phenotype_file_separator (string)]
Separator for the phenotype file (i.e. "\n") to delimit the different phenotypes/conditions of the RNA sequencing runs.

[-compare (string)]
Two or more phenotypes to compare. If unspecified, will be all phenotypes. Independent and dependent require 2 phenotypes, ANOVA can take anything above 2. Default: all phenotypes

[-method (string)]
Can either be "independent", "dependent" or "ANOVA". Performs Welch's t-test for independent, Wilcoxon's signed rank test for dependent, and Kruskal-Wallis H test for ANOVA. Default: ANOVA

[-has_labels (boolean)]
