DESCRIPTION
  Ribonorma Python v1.1

PARAMETERS
[-h]
Shows this interface.

[-in (string)]:
Input normalised file, as generated by ribonorma-normalise.

[-out (string)]
Optional output file. If not specified, will output plot as a PyPlot application window if plotting or stdout if not plotting.

[-phenotype_file (string)]
File for phenotype data.

[-infile_separator (string)]
Separator for the input file (i.e. "," for CSV). Default: \t

[-outfile_separator (string)]
Separator for the output file (i.e. "," for CSV). Default: \t

[-phenotype_file_separator (string)]
Separator for the phenotype file (i.e. "\n") to delimit the different phenotypes/conditions of the RNA sequencing runs.

[-plot (boolean)]
Whether or not to generate a violin plot as the output instead of a TSV output. Default: True

[-genes (string)]
List of genes to be compared, separated by a comma.

[-has_labels (boolean)]
First row in input normalised file are labels. Default: True

[-levene (boolean)]
Determines whether or not to compute Levene's test for equal variances. Default: False

[-ovl (boolean)]
Determines whether or not to compute the overlapping coefficient (OVL). Can be computationally expensive. Default: False

[-debug]
Triggers the debug mode.
